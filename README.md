# BTD6 AI TRUST

- very very basic algorithm (honestly sorta even brute force to some part) to try to beat btd6
- inspired by b2b studio's video about 3 years ago
- Hopefully it works eventually
- First actual big cpp project

### This is a personal project done on my free time because I thought it'd be very interesting
- So far I need to actually make the ai make decisions
- Most complicated math I've used is multiplication (not even division yet)
- me when above average challenging project is above average challenging
- guyss i had to mod btd6 to reliably get game data to feed to this thing
- yeah probaly will also link the btd6 mod (questionably made???) i made soon^tm
- what's an if statement
